\chapter{``Zdm'' Standard Extension for Double-Precision Moves, Version 0.1}
\label{sec:zdm}

This chapter describes the RV32-only Zdm extension, which adds instructions to
transfer double-precision floating-point values to and from integer registers.

\begin{commentary}
An analogous RV64-only Zqm extension is also under consideration, but its
choice of instruction encoding depends on an unresolved decision about the
RV128 encoding scheme.
\end{commentary}

The FMV.X.D instruction moves bits 63:32 of floating-point register {\em rs1}
into integer register {\em rd}.
It is encoded identically to the RV64 instruction of the same name.

\begin{commentary}
FMV.X.D is used in conjunction with the existing FMV.X.W instruction to move
a double-precision floating-point number to a pair of x-registers.
\end{commentary}

The FMV.D.X instruction moves a double-precision number from a pair of integer
registers into a floating-point register.  Integer registers {\em rs1} and
{\em rs2} supply bits 31:0 and 63:32, respectively; the result is written to
floating-point register {\em rd}.
FMV.D.X is encoded identically to the RV64 instruction of the same name,
except that instruction bit 13 is set and the {\em rs2} field need not be
zero.
